# TheLearner
The learner is a mobile robotics platform built to learn mapping, localization and path planning. The learner sports seven ultrasonic sensors, a 9 DOF IMU and an accelerometer.

I'm working on a state estimator node that uses a multisensor Extended Kalman Filter.
Update: a simulation of the node was developed in matlab and I'm currently implementing it on the robot. 
I included images of it's performance in the simulations folder.
