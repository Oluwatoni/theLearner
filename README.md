# theLearner
The learner is a platform to learn localization, mapping and path planning. I'm currently implementing the robot localization using with an EKF.

The learner sports 7 30 degree ultrasonic sensors, a 9 DOF IMU and an accelerometer.
Code for an NMEA parser is also in this repo. I will remove it from this project soon.
